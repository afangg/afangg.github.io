  description: I am assisting Ph.D student <a href="https://anthonysimeonov.github.io/">Anthony Simeonov</a> with his research under the Improbable AI group on a framework for solving long horizon planning for the manipulation of rigid objects without the use of 3D models, relying on point-cloud observations. See <a href="https://anthonysimeonov.github.io/rpo-planning-framework/">here</a> for more detail. <br><br>I created and integrated a PointNet++ model for point cloud segmentation into the framework's skill sampler pipeline with the goal of evaluating the performance of its prediction compared to the existing model that does not utilize feature layers.<br/><br/><strong>Tools and Technology Used:</strong> Python, PyTorch, ROS, DGL package
