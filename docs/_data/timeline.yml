  description: I worked on a tactical data link simulation software that generates data link messages and outputs them in exercise scenarios on a newly developed UI display. I worked on improving data transfer between the classic platform and new UI on the backend. I also made it easier to transfer pre-loaded data between machines and handled requests between client and server.<br/><br/>Besides the technical skills I gained from this experience, I also learned how to carry out the software development process following the scrum framework. <br/><br/><strong>Tools and Technology Used:</strong> C++, Go, Javascript, HTML/CSS

  description: My lab was the Object Based Media Group helping Ph.D. student <a href="http://www.shtarbanov.com/">Ali Shtarbanov</a> with his project Flow IO (formally know as Bubble), an open source development platform for pneumatics and soft actuator application. It includes a custom API and a physical device of electro valves, micro pumps, and soft actuators.<br/><br/>I improved usability of the platform by enabling remote control of the peripheral by building an iOS mobile app to connect and transmit data to control individual valves and pumps. <br/><br/><strong>Tools and Technology Used:</strong> Swift, XCode, Arduino, BLE, Core Bluetooth

  description: In the summers of 2019 and 2020 I supported about 15 CSSI-Coursera student with coursework as a TA by promoting a safe educational environment and led personalized weekly meetings for the whole summer. I also assisted students with career and academic preparation by reviewing resumes, recommending college course, and discussing job and research interests. My goal was to help my peers with their transition to college and CS.
