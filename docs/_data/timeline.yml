    A proud resident of Simmons Hall, in my time at MIT I've had the opportunity to explore my interests whether it be dedicating time to the Undergraduate Association - Technology group, MIT Media Lab, Aerospace Controls Lab, MIT Roboteam, or even taking classes in design, philosophy, and photography!<br/><br/>Relevent Courses I've taken include Discrete Mathsmatics, Differential Equations, Circuits and Electronics, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Feedback Controls, and Robotics

  from: Jun 2020
  to: Aug 2020
  description: I worked on TIGER, a Tactical Data Link simulation system that generates data link messages and outputs them in exercise scenarios on a newly developed UI display. I minimized error in data transferring between classic TIGER and the new UI by adding support for the TCP/IP protocol using C++ and ASIO. I also made it easier to transfer pre-loaded data between machines by implementing the ability to export the data to JSON files and importing them to a database.<br/><br/>Besides the technical skills I gained from this experience, I also learned how to carry out the software development process following the scrum/agile framework. Because of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, my internship became remote, and despite this being my first college internship, I had no trouble getting set up and working with little support from my team.

  from: Feb 2019
  to: Dec 2019
  description: My lab was the Object Based Media Group helping Ph.D. student <a href="http://www.shtarbanov.com/">Ali Shtarbanov</a> with his project Flow IO (formally know as Bubble), an open source development platform for pneumatics and soft actuator application. It includes a custom API and a physical device of electro valves, micro pumps, and soft actuators.<br/><br/>I improved usability of the platform by enabling remote control of the peripheral by building an iOS mobile app to connect and transmit data to control individual valves and pumps. I also added BLE support in the firmware using the Bluefruit Arduino library. While improving the hardware and power consumption of the device in each iteration, I conducted multiple experiments to record power, air flow, and pressure of the components, and documented these measurementsin a data sheet for public use.

  from: Jun
  to: Aug 2019 and 2020
  description: In the summers of 2019 and 2020 I supported about 15 CSSI-Coursera student with coursework as a TA by promoting a safe educational environment and led personalized weekly meetings. I also assisted students with career and academic preparation by reviewing resumes, recommending college course, and discussing job and research interests. I volunteered to help incoming college freshman with the transisiton to college because I was once in their shoes and this is a resource I would've liked.
