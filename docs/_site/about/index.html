<p>Hi I am <strong>Alisha Fong</strong> <img class="emoji" title=":wave:" alt=":wave:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" height="20" width="20">,<br>
I’m currently a Junior at the <strong>Massachusettes Institute of Technology</strong> majoring in <em>Computer Science and Electrical Engineering</em>. In the field of CS, my current passions include <strong>robotics</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>. I’ve always been interested in creating products that impact a large audience, and I believe autonomous systems designed to operate in an unstructured environment is the future of consumer products. Beyond that I’ve had experiences in software, mobile app, and web development along with embedded systems.\</p>

<p>Outside of classes I enjoy playing badminton, swimming, taking film and digital photography, cooking and trying new places to eat, and playing video games such as Minecraft and games on the Nintendo Switch! Thank you for taking the time to view my website. I hope you learn something new about me.</p>

          <h2>BS in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Massachusettes Institute of Technology</h2>
          <h6 class="date">2018 — Present</h6>
          <p>I've proudly resided at Simmons Fall for two years and loved the community of the Sponge. In my time at MIT I've had the opportunity to explore my interests whether it be dedicating time to the Undergraduate Association - Technology group, MIT Media Lab, Aerospace Controls Lab, MIT Roboteam, or even taking classes in design, philosophy, photography, and archeology!<br><br>Relevent Courses I've taken include Discrete Mathsmatics, Differential Equations, Circuits and Electronics, Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, Feedback Controls, and Robotics</p>

          <h2>Software Development Intern, Northrop Grumman</h2>
          <h6 class="date">Jun 2020 — Aug 2020</h6>
          <p>My project was the TIGER, a Tactical Data Link simulation system that generates data link messages and outputs them in exercise scenarios on a newly developed UI display. I worked on minimizing error data transferring between classic TIGER and the new UI by adding support for the TCP/IP protocol using C++ and ASIO. Another goal I accomplished was allowing for easier transfer of pre-loaded data such as templates, scenarios, areas of interests, and user settings between machines using Go. I added the ability to export such data to a JSON file and the ability to import these files and add the content into the database.<br><br>Besides the technical skills I gained from this experience, I also learned how to carry out the software development process following the scrum/agile framework. Because of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, my internship became remote, and despite this being my first college internship, I had no trouble getting set up and working with little support from my team. I'm proud of all I've learned and accomplished on my own and super thankful for my amazing team</p>

          <h2>Undergraduate Researcher, MIT Media Lab</h2>
          <h6 class="date">Feb 2019 — Dec 2019</h6>
          <p>My first goal after entering MIT was to work at the Media Lab. Their interdisciplinary research was fascinating to me and I wanted to work on the intersection of design, hardware, and software. I found a position at the Object Based Media Group helping Ph.D. student <a href="http://www.shtarbanov.com/">Ali Shtarbanov</a> with his project Flow IO (formally know as Bubble). Flow IO is an open source development platform for pneumatics and soft actuator application and includes a perihperal of electro valves, pumps, and pneumatics.<br><br>Ali wanted to improve usability of the platform by allowing users to control the device easier. I enabled remote control of the peripheral by building an iOS mobile app to connect and transmit data to control individual valves and pumps. I also added BLE support in the firmware using the Bluefruit Arduino library. Because we were constantly going through iterations of the platform to improve the hardware and power consumption of the device, I also conducted multiple experiments to record power, air flow, and pressure of the components, and I documented these measurements and compiled them in a data sheet for public use.</p>
