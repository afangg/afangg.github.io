<h3> Hi I am <i>{{ site.author.name }}</i> :wave: </h3>

<p>I'm a senior at the <strong>Massachusettes Institute of Technology</strong> majoring in <i>Computer Science and Electrical Engineering</i>. I will be pursing a Masters of Engineering with a concentration in Artifical Intelligence next year. </p>

<p>In the field of CS, my current passions include <strong>autonomous systems</strong> and <strong>software development</strong>. I've always been interested in creating products that impact a large audience, and I believe robotic systems designed to operate in an unstructured environment is the future of consumer products.</p>

Outside of classes I enjoy playing badminton, film and digital photography, and playing video games.
