<h3> Hi I am <i>{{ site.author.name }}</i> :wave: </h3>

<p>I'm student at the <strong>Massachusettes Institute of Technology</strong> majoring in <i>Computer Science and Electrical Engineering</i> with a concentration in Artifical Intelligence. I'm working in Pulkit Agrawal's lab <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/">Improbable AI</a> to solve some improbable problems.</p>

<p>In the field of CS, my passions include <strong>autonomous systems</strong> and <strong>software development</strong>. I've always been interested in creating products that impact a large audience, and I believe if robotic systems and AI are scalable and ethical, they can not only improve our quality of life, but also tackle some of the world's most pressing problems.</p>

I also enjoy film photography, anime, and badminton.
