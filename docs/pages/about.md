# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm currently a Junior at the **Massachusettes Institute of Technology** majoring in *Computer Science and Electrical Engineering*. In the field of CS, my current passions include **robotics** and **machine learning**. I've always been interested in creating products that impact a large audience, and I believe autonomous systems designed to operate in an unstructured environment is the future of consumer products. Beyond that I've had experiences in software, mobile app, and web development along with embedded systems.

Outside of classes I enjoy playing badminton, swimming, taking film and digital photography, cooking and trying new places to eat, and playing video games such as Minecraft and games on the Nintendo Switch! Thank you for taking the time to view my website. I hope you learn something new about me.
