# 6.170: Software Studio

6.170 is about designing software which includes conceptual design, data design, UI/UX design, and ethics consideration of the software we build. We built web applications using a full web stack of modern technologies like Node, Express, and Vue.

Fritter is our version of Twitter! Users can make an account to post "freets," upvote these posts, repost freets, and follow users. I did the fullstack development of the application from creating a RESTful web service and managing user sessions in the backend to the API calls and UI on the frontend.

<br>For the final project I worked with three other students to design and build a website. Our application, Cambridge Connect, is a platform to centralize information on city meetings happening in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Here residents can view upcoming events, subscribe to meetings, follow groups relevent to their interests, and have discussion with other users on current city topics all while earning badges for engagement.

<br>I had full ownership of user accounts and I built the API for users, managing session cookies, persistent storage of users, along with the Log In screen and Accounts page.
