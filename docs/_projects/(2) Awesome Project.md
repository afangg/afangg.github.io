# Mobile Autonomous System Laboratory 2020

[MASLAB](http://maslab.mit.edu/2020/) is an annual robotics competition during MIT's Independents Activities Period in the month of January where teams of 3-5 build an autonomous robot to compete in a challenge designed for that year. This program is completely student driven, from the TAs who host it, to the students who design and build their submitions from scratch.

## The Challenge

This year, the challenge involved collecting red and green cylinders throughout the stage and placing them into goal areas to score points. Points were determined by which goal a cylinder was deposited into. They could either be pushed into marked areas on the ground or hung on pegs on the arena walls.
